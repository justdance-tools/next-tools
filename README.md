## next-tools

![](example.png?raw=true)

Next Tools is for managing Next files.
What you can do:
  - Convert Next to UAF
  - Convert UAF to Next
  - Fix broken JD+ bundles
  - Fetch online catalog from Next servers
  and more to come...

Next games are not released yet, so the tool is currently unfinished and needs a lot of work to do. It is currently based off the early build files of Next.

## Requirements

*   Node.JS (14 or higher)

## To run

You must need Windows to use Next Tools. It's because this tool uses Powershell scripts, shell scripts (for Linux and distros) will be added in future.

First, run these commands below:
```
git pull https://github.com/justdance-tools/next-tools
cd next-tools
npm i
```

You can now either run `node index.js` in CLI or run the `run.bat` file.
