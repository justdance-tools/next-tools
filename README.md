## next-tools

Next Tools will help you convert files between UAF and Next.

Next games are not released yet, so the tool is currently unfinished and needs a lot of work to do. It is currently based off the early build files of Next.

## Requirements

*   Node.JS (14 or higher)

## To run

You must need Windows to use Next Tools. It's because this tool uses Powershell scripts, shell scripts (for Linux and distros) will be added in future.

First, run `npm i` in CLI to install all required packages.

You can either run `node index.js` Â in CLI or run the `run.bat` file.
